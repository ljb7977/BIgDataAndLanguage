Gail Minglana Martinez, Mother in Air Force Family, Dies in Brussels Attacks
They posed against a bright yellow background, both of them in blue shirts, broad smiles across their faces.
“21 years with this man!” Gail Minglana Martinez wrote on Facebook last summer alongside the photo of herself and her husband, Kato Martinez, a United States Air Force officer. She tagged the photo as having been taken at the Leaning Tower of Pisa.
She also posted a picture of their four children — “Our fantabulous monkeys!” she said — taken against the same colorful wall.
All six family members were wounded in the March 22 attacks in Brussels. On Wednesday, Representative Blake Farenthold, Republican of Texas, said in a statement that Ms. Martinez, 41, had died of her injuries.
The rest of the family remains hospitalized, according to the statement, which did not give the date of Ms. Martinez’s death. Mr. Farenthold’s district includes Corpus Christi, where Ms. Martinez grew up.
