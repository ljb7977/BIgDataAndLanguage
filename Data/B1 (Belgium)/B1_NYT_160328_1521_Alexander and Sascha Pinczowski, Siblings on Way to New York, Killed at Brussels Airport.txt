Alexander and Sascha Pinczowski, Siblings on Way to New York, Killed at Brussels Airport
Alexander and Sascha Pinczowski were siblings living in Belgium, but they never lingered in one place for long. The children of a hotel manager, they had lived in Turkey, Greece and Germany, and were on their way back to New York, a city they both loved, when they arrived at the departures hall at Brussels Airport on Tuesday.
Mr. Pinczowski was going to meet his fiancée in New York, where he and his sister recently lived, so they could attend a wedding together in North Carolina. His sister was planning to spend the weekend with friends. They were standing in the Delta ticket line and were on the phone with their mother, Marjan Pinczowski-Fasbender, when two bombs exploded.
James Cain, the father of Mr. Pinczowski’s fiancée, Cameron Cain, said in an interview that family and friends who had gathered in Brussels learned Friday morning that Ms. Pinczowski, 26, and Mr. Pinczowski, 29, had not survived the blasts.
Mr. Pinczowski and Ms. Cain, who met five years ago in North Carolina, both loved to travel and were interested in world news and politics.
“The first time I met him, I thought ‘Gosh, this young man thinks he knows more than I do about international affairs,’ ” said Mr. Cain, a former United States ambassador to Denmark. “And after a year or so, I realized, ‘He does.’ ”
