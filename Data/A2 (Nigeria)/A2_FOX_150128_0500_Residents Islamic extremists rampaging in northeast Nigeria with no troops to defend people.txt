Residents Islamic extremists rampaging in northeast Nigeria with no troops to defend people
YOLA, Nigeria –  Residents say Islamic extremists are rampaging through villages in northeast Nigeria's Adamawa state and no troops have deployed to protect civilians.
They say more than 40 people have been killed in seven villages, houses and mosques have been burned down and businesses and homes looted this week.
State legislator Adamu Kamale says he has appealed in vain to authorities to send troops since the attacks began on Friday and militants Monday attacked Michika town.
People fleeing militant attacks in neighboring Borno state report Boko Haram fighters say they are preparing "a big grave" for them in Maiduguri, the biggest city in the northeast where troops repelled an offensive by hundreds of militants Sunday.
The extremists who denounce democracy are increasing attacks as Nigeria prepares for Feb. 14 elections.
