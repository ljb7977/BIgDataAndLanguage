Remains of couple killed in Belgium returned to Kentucky
The remains of a couple with Kentucky and Tennessee ties who were killed in terrorist attacks in Belgium last month have been returned to Lexington.
The Lexington Herald-Leader reports the remains of 29-year-old Stephanie Shults and 30-year-old Justin Shults arrived in Lexington late Sunday from a military base in Dover, Delaware. The funeral is planned Friday in Lexington.
Stephanie Shults was a graduate of Bryan Station High School and Transylvania University and worked for a division of Mars in Brussels. Justin Shults was from Gatlinburg, Tennessee, and worked for Clarcor in Brussels. They met at Vanderbilt University while working on their master's degrees.
They were at the airport to say goodbye to Stephanie Shults' mother, Carolyn Moore of Lexington, who had been visiting. Moore suffered minor injuries.
