A Terror Attack, Then Far Right Moves In
MARSEILLE, France — In the United States and Europe, mainstream political parties find themselves besieged. Two-party systems that were once stable are under new pressure, fracturing and creating openings for populists on the extremes, left and right.
This week in Brussels, far-right protesters disrupted a memorial gathering for victims of the terrorist attacks on March 22. In the United States, Donald J. Trump has shaken up Republican elites in this year’s presidential primary contests. In Germany and Austria, extreme-right parties are surging. Spain remains paralyzed after an election that punished the political establishment and scattered votes across the spectrum.
In France, the far-right National Front has hammered at the political mainstream for decades, to limited effect. But a surge of migrants into Europe, as well as the bombings in Brussels last week and two major attacks in Paris last year, have left the National Front with the political winds at its back, after years of trying to sanitize its image as an extremist party.
It has seized issues ready-made for its base, calling for France First, or a France for the French, in elliptical anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim language. Such appeals have resonated more broadly with a public worried about security, migration and economic stagnation. Others have been drawn to the party by a vague but nagging belief that politics as usual has done more to serve politicians and moneyed interests than ordinary people.
Weeks after the Nov. 13 Paris attacks, The New York Times followed a local candidate for the National Front, Stéphane Ravier, as he campaigned for regional elections in Marseille.
“For 40 years, it’s been the same politicians in Europe,” Mr. Ravier said, chatting with a butcher on the campaign trail. “Right now, it’s really a mess. In this country, it’s never good to be right too early.”
