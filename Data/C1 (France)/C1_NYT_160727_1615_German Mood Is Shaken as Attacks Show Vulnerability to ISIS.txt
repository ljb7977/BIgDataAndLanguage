German Mood Is Shaken as Attacks Show Vulnerability to ISIS
BERLIN — After a week bookended by terrorist attacks, Germans are now clear that they, too, are targets of the Islamic State, leaving them longing for the sense of order that is their pride and bedrock of success.
The attacks started with an ax-wielding teenager on a train on July 18 and ended with a backpack bomber on the terrace of a wine bar on Sunday. In between — unrelated to Islamist terrorism, but no less unsettling — an Iranian-German carried out a mass shooting in a Munich shopping mall, and a recently arrived 21-year-old Syrian refugee killed his girlfriend outside a kebab shop, according to the authorities.
The arrival of such violence in normally placid Germany has added to an anxiety-provoking summer for Europe.
Germans were already feeling a loss of control and grappling with the cultural clashes, like sexual assaults that opened the year in Cologne, ushered in by a chaotic storm of migration last year.
Still, before this week, many were inclined to put faith in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s exhortation that “we can do this” when it came to integrating the nearly one million migrants and refugees to whom she had opened the country’s doors.
