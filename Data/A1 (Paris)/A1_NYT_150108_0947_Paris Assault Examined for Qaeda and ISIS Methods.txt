Paris Assault Examined for Qaeda and ISIS Methods  

Wednesday’s attack on a satirical newspaper in Paris prompted speculation about the involvement of an organized terrorist group, possibly the Islamic State, whose leaders have called for sympathizers to carry out assaults wherever they can. These “lone wolf” attacks have included the siege of a cafe in Sydney, Australia, last month; an attack on the Jewish Museum in Brussels in May; and a gunman’s rampage through the Parliament building in Ottawa in October.
Even as French and other Western intelligence and counterterrorism officials said they had not yet determined which extremist groups, if any, might have been involved in the attack in Paris, some veteran analysts and terror experts suggested that Al Qaeda or one of its affiliates might be implicated.
They point out that the operation against Charlie Hebdo — a satirical French newspaper known for its cartoons lampooning religious extremism, including a tongue-in-cheek portrayal of the Prophet Muhammad — was led by at least three assailants, in contrast to the wave of lone-gunman attacks attributed to extremists inspired by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
Furthermore, they said, it showed a degree of sophistication and forethought that was lacking from those carried out by Islamic State sympathizers — like the Sydney siege, led by a convert to Islam who brought the wrong jihadist flag to the scene of the attack and later asked the police to bring him the correct one.
One witness to the attack in Paris on Wednesday, Cédric Le Béchec, 33, a real estate agent, told a French publication that the gunmen had yelled, “Tell the media that we are Al Qaeda in Yemen.”
Peter Neumann, a terrorism expert at King’s College London, said that the assault in Paris looked more organized than previous lone-wolf attacks and that it was possible that a branch of Al Qaeda was behind it.
Jean-Paul Rouiller, director of the Geneva Center for Training and Analysis of Terrorism, said that in the previous attacks, targets were chosen only because they were Western, and were missing the symbolism that often came with Qaeda-led assaults.
