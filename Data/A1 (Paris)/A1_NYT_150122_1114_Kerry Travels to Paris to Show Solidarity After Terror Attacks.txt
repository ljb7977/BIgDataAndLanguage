Kerry Travels to Paris to Show Solidarity After Terror Attacks

PARIS — Secretary of State John Kerry on Friday capped off a morning full of high-level meetings and wreath-laying to commemorate France’s struggle against terrorism by welcoming James Taylor at Paris’s ornate City Hall.
After strumming a few bars of “La Marseillaise,” the national anthem of France, Mr. Taylor lowered his head and played “You’ve Got a Friend,” singing the final words in French.
Mr. Kerry had said on Thursday that he wanted to “share a big hug with Paris” to demonstrate American friendship with “the longest ally in our history” after a three-day onslaught last week in which Islamist militants killed 17 people.
His visit here represented the Obama administration’s effort to correct its failure to send a top official to a mass rally and solidarity march in Paris on Sunday that was attended by leaders of more than 40 countries.
If anybody was in a position to erase an impression of American indifference to France, it was Mr. Kerry, a Francophile who speaks French and has already made 18 trips to Paris as secretary of state. And for much of the day, Mr. Kerry did everything possible to try to do just that.
