Texas Boy Known as ‘Copeland Crush’ and His Father Are Mourned
AUSTIN, Tex. — Brodie Copeland, 11, one of the victims of the attack in Nice, France, was such a hard-hitting baseball player that teammates at his club in Texas called him the “Copeland Crush.”
He played second base with the Hill Country Baseball Club, near Austin.
The owner of the club, Jonathan Paiz, said Brodie got his nickname because he would “crush” it when at bat.
“Basically he would get up there and hit the ball hard,” Mr. Paiz said in a telephone interview.
Brodie and his father, Sean Copeland, 51, were two of the victims of the attack, which killed at least 82 others, including nine other children and teenagers, and wounded 202 people.
Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, noting that the attack occurred less than a year after the attacks in and around Paris, said that for the second time in nine months, the French flag was being flown over the Texas Governor’s Mansion in remembrance.
“While every heinous attack like this is tragic,” he said in a statement, “this latest one hits close to home.”
The Copelands were the only two Americans who had been confirmed dead as of Friday night.
Three students from the University of California, Berkeley, were among the wounded, according to a statement issued Friday by the university. Two of the students, Vladyslav Kostiuk, 23, and Diane Huang, 20, were discharged after medical treatment and returned to their summer dormitories in Nice, the university said. Daryus Medora, 21, whose leg was broken, remained in the hospital.
