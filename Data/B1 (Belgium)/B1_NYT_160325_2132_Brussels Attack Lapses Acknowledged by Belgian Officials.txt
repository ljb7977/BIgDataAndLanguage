Brussels Attack Lapses Acknowledged by Belgian Officials
BRUSSELS — Top Belgian  officials on Thursday acknowledged miscommunications and other errors in the prelude to the Brussels suicide bombings, as growing evidence of links to the Paris assaults by the Islamic State suggested that a wide network of trained attackers leading back to Syria is now rooted in Europe.
The Belgian justice and interior ministers acknowledged that their departments should have acted on a Turkish alert about Ibrahim el-Bakraoui, a convicted Belgian criminal briefly arrested in Turkey last year on suspicion of terrorist activity, who turned out to be one of the suicide bombers. And the Belgian prosecutor’s office said that man’s brother, Khalid — another suicide bomber — had been wanted since December in connection with the Paris attacks.
Taken together, they amounted to the first high-level acknowledgment that European officials could have done more to avert the bombings, and came amid other recriminations in the European Union about recurrent failures among its national police forces and intelligence services to share information.
New raids in connection with the Brussels bombings were carried out Thursday night in the city’s Schaerbeek and Jette neighborhoods, and the police held six people for questioning.
At the same time, officials in France said a French citizen had been arrested in the Argenteuil suburb of Paris on suspicion that he was involved in the “advanced stages” of a terrorist plot. The French interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, said that “at this point” there were no tangible links between that plot and the Paris and Brussels attacks.
Even as investigators have collaborated in Belgium and France since the Paris attacks four months ago, which by all accounts were planned in Belgium, they were caught unaware by the Brussels attack on Tuesday, which killed 31 people and wounded 300 in the airport and a busy subway station.
