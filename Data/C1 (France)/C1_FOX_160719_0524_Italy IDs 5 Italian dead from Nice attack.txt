Italy IDs 5 Italian dead from Nice attack
Italy says five of the 84 dead in the Nice truck attack were Italians, including two couples celebrating a recent retirement.
The Foreign Ministry identified the dead as Maria Grazia Ascoli, 77, and Mario Casati, 90, of Milan; Angelo D'Agostino, 71, and his wife Gianna Muset, 68, both of Voghera, and Carla Gaveglio, 48, of Piasco, in the Piedmont region.
Italian news reports said Ascoli and Casati, along with D'Agostino and Muset, had traveled to Nice together to celebrate D'Agostino's retirement.
In a statement Tuesday, the Foreign Ministry said French authorities had formalized the identification overnight. It said the families had been notified and that the ministry expressed its solidarity "to the family and friends of the victims of the barbarous attack."
