BAGHDAD ? Iraqi officials say the death toll from Sunday¡¯s devastating truck bombing at a bustling Baghdad commercial street has climbed to 142.

The bombing, claimed by the Islamic State group, was the deadliest terror attack in Iraq in a year and one of the worst single bombings in more than a decade of war and insurgency.

Police and health officials said Monday that the death toll is likely to increase as rescuers are still looking for missing people. At least 185 people were wounded. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they are not authorized to talk to reporters.

Sunday¡¯s attack underscored the IS group¡¯s ability to strike the Iraqi capital despite a string of battlefield losses elsewhere in the country and fueled public anger toward their political leadership.
