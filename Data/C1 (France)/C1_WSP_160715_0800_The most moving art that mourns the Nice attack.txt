The most moving art that mourns the Nice attack
YET AGAIN, we turn our mourning eyes toward France.
Yet again, so soon after the last massacre in a hurting nation, another attack of apparent terrorism strikes, this time along the French Riviera.

And again, we try to absorb the toll exacted by murderous evil targeting innocent civilians.
Some say, “Remember Brussels,” but we haven’t even had time to forget it, as Europe endures another heart-rending blow said by authorities to be motivated by hate.
Eighty-four dead so far. Scores injured. And all because of one armed driver, now dead.
And Bastille Day becomes an anniversary of a different sort, as well: Liberty strafed by grief.
The world reaches out to Nice, and prays for its victims. Three days of mourning are declared. Hearts and flags again fly at half-staff.
And again, as France forever burns as a beacon of art and culture, illustrations and paintings naturally stream forth as an act of solidarity — of healing through unity.
Here is some of the art to emerge so far in response to just the latest French tragedy:
