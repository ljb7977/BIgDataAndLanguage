France Seeks to Extend Emergency Powers as It Prepares for Sports Events

PARIS â€” The French government will seek a two-month extension of the state of emergency it declared after the attacks in and around Paris that left 130 people dead in November, Prime Minister Manuel Valls said on Wednesday.
The move, which is expected to get the required parliamentary approval, comes as France prepares for the European Championship soccer tournament and the Tour de France this summer.
The two high-profile, well-attended events will pose a serious security challenge as the government tries to guarantee safety amid the increasing threat posed by Islamist extremists.
The attacks in November included three suicide bombers who struck outside a soccer match at the Stade de France, a stadium in the northern Paris suburb of St.-Denis that will be the site of the final game of the soccer tournament.
Seven million people are expected to attend events related to the soccer tournament, either by attending the 51 matches that will be played in 10 stadiums or by watching the games at fan zones that can accommodate 10,000 to 100,000.
