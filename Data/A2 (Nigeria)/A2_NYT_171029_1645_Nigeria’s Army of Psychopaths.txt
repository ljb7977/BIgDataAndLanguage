Nigeria’s Army of Psychopaths
LAGOS, Nigeria — Here in ’s commercial hub, it is tempting to regard , the Islamist terrorist group that for more than five years has waged war in the country’s far northeast, as a distant tragedy. We are, of course, aware of the fallout: the thousands of deaths, the hundreds of thousands of displaced persons, the destroyed infrastructure — schools, churches, mosques, homes, police stations — that will take years, and millions of dollars, to rebuild. But in southern Nigeria, it is easy to feel removed from the crisis.
The reality, though, is that the insurgency’s impact ripples out across the country. A visit last year to a popular fabric market in Abeokuta, a city about 60 miles north of Lagos, brought this home to me.
I was there to interview the merchants about their work. When we talked about the challenges they faced, I expected the usual: electricity, taxation, access to . So I was surprised when one woman mentioned Boko Haram. A number of her customers lived in northern Nigeria and had stopped placing orders since the insurgency began.
The trade links between north and south are even more apparent in agriculture. Much of Nigeria’s food comes from the troubled region. Potiskum, a city that the jihadist militants have attacked on several occasions in recent years, killing dozens, is one of the largest cattle markets in West Africa. , the village from which hundreds of girls were abducted last April, is a village of farmers, growing grain that goes to market across the country.
I spoke with the father of one of the missing girls last year, a few months after the abductions. Like many farmers in the area, he was too scared to go out in the fields to plant anything, and the season was almost over. Not only would he be unable to feed his remaining family, but there would also be nothing to sell.
