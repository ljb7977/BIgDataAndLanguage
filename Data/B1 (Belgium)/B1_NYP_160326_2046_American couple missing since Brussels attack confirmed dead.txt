American couple missing since Brussels attack confirmed dead
Tennessee native Justin Shults died in the attack at the Brussels airport, it was confirmed Saturday after his missing wife’s car was found there.
“We found out today that cowards took my brother’s life just weeks after his 30th birthday,” tweeted the Vanderbilt grad’s brother, Levi Sutton, who had been using social media to update the search since the attacks in the Belgian capital.
“Knowing that I’ll never be able to see him again hurts but it’s worse that my future children will never get to know their uncle Justin, as he would’ve been a tremendous role model,” Sutton wrote.
There was no information released about Shults’ wife, Stephanie, who went missing with him. The car belonging to Stephanie, 29, a Kentucky native, was parked at the airport since Tuesday morning. The couple had driven her mother, Carolyn Moore, to the airport when the blast occurred. Moore survived.
Belgian authorities had not published a list of the 28 people killed and 300 wounded at the airport and a subway by Saturday.
Two other Americans were killed, including the unidentified wife of a US Air Force lieutenant colonel, and at least a dozen were injured.

Earlier in the week, family members confirmed that siblings Alexander and Sascha Pinczowski were among those killed. The two, who were 29 and 26, respectively, were Dutch nationals who lived in New York City.
Sascha had warned four months ago that demonizing Muslims would help drive recruitment of extremists.
Her mother, Marjan Pinczowski-Fasbender, reposted a Facebook post from Sascha that was written on Nov. 16, following the Paris terror attacks, that said, “Ignorant spreading of anti-Muslim sentiment and propaganda does nothing but benefit ISIS.”
