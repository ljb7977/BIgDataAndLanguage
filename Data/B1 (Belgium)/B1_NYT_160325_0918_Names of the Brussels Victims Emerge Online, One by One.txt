Names of the Brussels Victims Emerge Online, One by One
In the hours after the deadly suicide bombings in Brussels on Tuesday, relatives and friends of Léopold Hecht, a Belgian college student, were hoping that he would emerge safely from the chaos. Without his cellphone, maybe, and perhaps in a hospital bed, but safe.
Without reliable cellular reception and with the city locked down, loved ones turned to social media. On Twitter and Facebook, they distributed photographs of Mr. Hecht, a sandy-haired law student at Saint-Louis University in Brussels who enjoyed skiing and acting.
“For those who haven’t seen it, we’re still in search of Léopold Hecht,” a relative, Hadrien Hecht, wrote on Facebook on Tuesday afternoon. “If you have any info, contact me.”
After several hours, an update appeared: Mr. Hecht, 20, was in a hospital.
But on Wednesday morning, Pierre Jadoul, the president of Saint-Louis University, announced that he had died.
The death of Mr. Hecht, one of the 31 people killed in the bombings, illustrates how both hope and misinformation can flourish in the echo chamber of social media after a terrorist attack. For the families and friends of those who died and of some of the additional 300 who were hurt, the hours have been marked by constant communication but relatively little useful information.
“Pray for my best friend and her brother that were at the Brussels airport during the attacks,” Alexa Eskinazi, a friend of a brother and sister who have not been heard from since they arrived at the airport, wrote on Facebook on Tuesday. “We still have not heard any news.”
