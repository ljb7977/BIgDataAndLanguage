After the Terrorist Attack in Paris

To the Editor:
Re “Terrorists Strike Paris Newspaper, Leaving 12 Dead” (front page, Jan. 8): This Muslim unequivocally condemns the terror attack at the office of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris, which killed 12 people, including the top editor, cartoonists and two police officers. The act is thought to have been carried out by Muslim extremists in response to the newspaper’s history of publishing caricatures that denigrate the Prophet Muhammad.
I reiterate what I wrote in a letter after a firebombing of Charlie Hebdo three years ago: I wish the perpetrators recognized that Muhammad responded to hate with love, and to insult with prayer, and he insisted that his followers show the same type of forbearance against abuse.
Following the example of the Prophet, rather than misguided clerics who are notorious for prodding such atrocities, my prayers go out to the victims and their families.

The day after 9/11, Jean-Marie Colombani wrote in an editorial in Le Monde: “In this tragic moment, when words seem so inadequate to express the shock people feel, the first thing that comes to mind is this: We are all Americans! We are all New Yorkers.”
