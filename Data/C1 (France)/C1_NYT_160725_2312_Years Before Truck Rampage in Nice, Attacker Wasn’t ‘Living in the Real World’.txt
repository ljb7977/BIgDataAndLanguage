Years Before Truck Rampage in Nice, Attacker Wasn’t ‘Living in the Real World’
MSAKEN, Tunisia — His own parents were so frightened by his violence that they kicked him out when he was 16. Desperate, by the time he was 19, they dragged him to a psychiatrist, who prescribed an antipsychotic drug, a tranquilizer and an antidepressant.
“There were the beginnings of a psychosis,” the doctor, Hamouda Chemceddine, recalled in an interview in the Tunisian city of Sousse, looking over his notes from that visit in August 2004. “He wasn’t someone who was living in the real world.”
In France, he even created a Facebook page with an alter ego, listing his profession as a “professor of salsa dancing” and displaying a mock image of Nicolas Sarkozy, the former French president, in drag.
That man — a 31-year-old delivery driver, Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel — trained his violent tendencies on a crowd watching fireworks along the French Riviera on July 14, running over hundreds of people and killing 84 in a rented cargo truck during Bastille Day celebrations in Nice.
Since then, all of France has struggled to explain the single most murderous act yet committed by an individual since the country’s wave of terror began. Was Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel’s rampage terrorism or merely the outburst of a madman? Or both?
