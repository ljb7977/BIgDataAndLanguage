France arrests 54 for defending terrorism since massacre
PARIS — The Paris prosecutor’s office says 54 people have been detained for defending or glorifying terrorism since Islamic radicals began a rampage a week ago that left 17 people dead.
The arrests are part of a broader French crackdown that includes a government push for tougher anti-terrorism measures after the attacks, the worst in France in decades.
Dieudonne, a controversial comic with a large following in France, is among those detained.
Government spokesman Stephane Le Foll said Wednesday some of those detained have already been convicted.
