Charlie Hebdo terrorists held up gas station with grenade launcher
Stick ‘em up or I’ll shoot ​— with a rocket-propelled grenade launcher.
​Surveillance video released Monday shows the Charlie Hebdo terrorists holding up a gas station while brandishing a ​powerful RPG — part of their lethal arsenal of machine guns and bombs.
Al Qaeda-linked brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi appear to be skulking around the gas station and snack shop, filling a black plastic bag with food, water and other items last Thursday while they were on the run from police a day after the newspaper attack, The Daily Mail reported.
Cherif carried the RPG slung over his shoulder as he casually reached into a cooler to grab some drinks.
The photos were obtained by the French investigative website Mediapart, and also show the killers, who were not wearing masks, approaching the counter at the gas station.
The attendan​​t later called cops, who swarmed the area in a massive manhunt for the pair, who had killed 12 people a day before.
But the brothers eluded them, and were not caught until Friday after they had taken a hostage at a small printing plant near Charles de Gaulle Airport.
The pair also had Kalashnikov assault rifles, and cops found a dozen Molotov cocktails in a car they had stolen but later abandoned.
