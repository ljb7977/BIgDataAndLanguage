American Airlines issues statement on Brussels bombing as carriers cancel flights
American Airlines says earlier reports that the two explosions at Brussels international airport on Tuesday happened next to its check-in desk are wrong.
The air carrier said its check-in is at row 8 in the Zaventem airport departure hall, and that the explosions did not occur at row 8.
“American is taking care of employees and customers at Brussels Airport. At this time, all of our airport employees and crew members are safe and accounted for with no reported injuries.  American Airlines check-in operates at Row 8 of the departure hall, and the explosions did not occur at Row 8,” the airline said in a statement.
The airline has canceled flight 751 from Brussels to Philadelphia on Tuesday after the blasts,thought to be retaliation for the capture of Paris terror suspect Salah Abdeslam. In addition, United canceled four flights to Brussels and Delta two, according to FlightAware.com, a website that tracks commercial airlines. Flights to the U.S. by Delta, United, American and Brussels Airlines were also canceled.
Brussels airport had 397 flight cancellations by 8:30 a.m., according to FlightAware.com, which tracks flights.  All remaining flights to and from Brussels have been suspended until further notice.
At least 31 people have died in explosions and more than 150 wounded at the airport and at the Maalbeek Metro station in Brussels Tuesday. 
Many U.S. and global carriers issued rebooking policies in light of the attack.
American, Delta, Brussels Airlines, Air France and Air Canada are among other carriers that are allowing customers to change their travel plans or request a refund.  (See websites for more information)
In addition to the airport, Brussels authorities shut down the entire metro system after two explosions blew out the departures area at the airport and a second blast hit a metro station.
