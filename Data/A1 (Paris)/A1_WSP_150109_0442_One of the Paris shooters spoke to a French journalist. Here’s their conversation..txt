One of the Paris shooters spoke to a French journalist. Here’s their conversation.
A French reporter managed to reach Cherif Kouachi, one of the two gunmen suspected in France’s worst terrorist attack in generations, by telephone Friday shortly before he and his brother, Said Kouachi, were killed by police in a raid on their hideout northeast of Paris.
In the call, which lasted less than two minutes, Kouachi indicated that he and his brother acted on behalf of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), the terrorist group's affiliate in Yemen.  Journalist Igor Sahiri, who works for BFM-TV, recorded the phone call during his conversation with Kouachi.
Watch the full video below. Kouachi's phone call starts at the 0:43 mark.

Here is a partial translation of the conversation:





















In a video purportedly released by AQAP, which has since been taken down from YouTube, the group praised the attack on Charlie Hebdo.
"O Allah, let the praise be to You, for You have sufficed for Your Prophet against the scoffers. Praise be to You. You have supported Your worshipers the mujahideen. Praise be to Allah," the voice on the audio says.
