American Student, Nicolas Leslie, Died in Attack in Nice, France
LOS ANGELES — From the time he first got up on a surfboard (sometime around age 5), Nicolas Leslie seldom stood still.
Growing up in a beach town north of San Diego, he kite surfed and scuba dived. He captained his high school debate team. He spoke fluent Italian.
And as a 20-year-old junior at the University of California, Berkeley, he was determined to make a future for himself in business.
He had gone to Nice, France, for a summer entrepreneurship program, and was celebrating Bastille Day with classmates on the city’s waterfront when a man drove a 19-ton truck through the crowd, mowing down revelers. Mr. Leslie died in the attack, along with 83 others.
For days, Mr. Leslie’s whereabouts had remained unknown. He was not listed among the injured or the dead. His friends posted frantic messages on social media, searching for information about his whereabouts or condition.
