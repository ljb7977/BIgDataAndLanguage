As Britain Takes Stock of Iraq War, Iraqis Grimly Assess Its Aftermath

BAGHDAD — As Britain on Wednesday looked back on its decision to go to war in Iraq 13 years ago, Thamir al-Shemmary went to the funeral of his brother and two nephews, killed over the weekend in Baghdad’s deadliest terrorist attack since that war began.
Mr. Shemmary had a question for Tony Blair, the former British prime minister whose decision to join the invasion came under critique in the Chilcot Report, the exhaustive war inquiry released in London on Wednesday.
“Who will compensate me for the loss of my brother and his children?” he said. “Trust me, I am bleeding from the inside.”
With Britain consumed with re-litigating the familiar history of the Iraq war — the false intelligence assessments, the failure to plan for after the invasion — Iraq is consumed with the consequences of that history.
Wednesday should have been a joyous celebration of Eid al-Fitr, the holiday after the holy month of Ramadan that is normally filled with family gatherings, games, sweets and lavish meals.
