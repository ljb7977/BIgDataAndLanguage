India Lets Pakistani Team Examine Site of January Attack by Militants

NEW DELHI — In a rare show of cooperation, the Indian government on Tuesday permitted a team of Pakistani security officials to examine the scene of a militant attack at an air base in India that claimed the lives of six fighters and seven Indian soldiers in January.
The five-member security team, including military, police and intelligence officials, arrived in New Delhi on Sunday and met on Monday with the National Investigation Agency, which is handling the Indian investigation of the attack.
“During the interaction, N.I.A. officers gave a detailed presentation on the evidence collected during the course of the investigation,” said Sanjeev Kumar Singh, the inspector general of the agency, in a news briefing.
In a separate investigation, the Pakistani authorities said on Tuesday they had questioned more than 5,000 people and detained more than 200 of them in connection with the Lahore suicide bombing on Sunday that killed 73 people, including dozens of children, news agencies reported.
At least six militants infiltrated the Pathankot air base, in Punjab, on Jan. 2, digging themselves in and engaging in a dayslong gun battle with Indian security forces before they were killed. It took place just a week after Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India flew to Lahore for a meeting with his Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz Sharif. After the attack, India canceled a proposed visit of its foreign secretary to Pakistan to resume much-delayed talks.
