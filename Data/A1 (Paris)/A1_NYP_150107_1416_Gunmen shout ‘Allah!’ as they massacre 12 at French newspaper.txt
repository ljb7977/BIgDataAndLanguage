Gunmen shout ‘Allah!’ as they massacre 12 at French newspaper
Masked terrorists toting AK-47s and shouting “Allahu akbar” carried out a commando-style raid on an Islam-mocking Paris newspaper Wednesday, methodically killing 12 people — including a Muslim cop they gunned down on the sidewalk as he pleaded for his life.
The bloodbath at the satirical paper Charlie Hebdo was precisely planned for a weekly editorial meeting at the paper’s office near the famed Bastille monument, the self-proclaimed “al Qaeda” gunmen bursting in seeking out journalists by name whom they planned to slaughter, witnesses and cops said.
The jihadis headed straight for the paper’s editorial director and cartoonist, Stephane Charbonnier — widely known by his pen name Charb — killing him and his police bodyguard at about 11:30 a.m. local time, said Christophe Crepin, a ­police spokesman.
Two of the men could be seen on a video that shows them as they left the newspaper building, one shouting “Allah!” and firing his assault rifle at pursuing cops.
The black-masked jihadist wounded one officer, a 42-year-old Muslim policeman named Ahmed Merabet.
The video shows the two gunmen run across the street to stalk the prone officer — who held up his arms and begged for mercy.
“Do you want to kill me?” the pinned-down cop asked.
“OK, chief,” the masked terrorist replied before shooting him dead, The Times of London reported.
A witness described the cowardly execution.
“They knew exactly what they had to do and exactly where to shoot. While one kept watch and checked that the traffic was good for them, the other one delivered the final coup de grâce,” he said.
“It was a butchery, a carnage,” said Rocco Contento, a police spokesman.
In a video clip on TV network iTELE, the men can be heard shouting: “We have killed Charlie Hebdo! We have avenged the Prophet Mohammed!”
