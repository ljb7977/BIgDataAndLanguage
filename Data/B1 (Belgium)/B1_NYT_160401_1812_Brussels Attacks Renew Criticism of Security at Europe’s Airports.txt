Brussels Attacks Renew Criticism of Security at Europe’s Airports
LONDON —  The suicide attacks at Brussels Airport have led to intensified scrutiny of hiring, security and the lack of standardized procedures at airports across Europe, amid questions about whether the bombings last week could have been prevented.
The head of the largest police union in Belgium warned on Thursday of a serious security problem at Brussels Airport, citing systematic security flaws, bureaucratic incompetence and the employment of baggage handlers with criminal records.
His remarks came as the airport police wrote an open letter, cited in several Belgian newspapers, expressing deep concern about the level of security at the airport, echoing worries about procedures, staffing and the potential for infiltration by terrorists at Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport after the deadly attacks in and near Paris in November.
Since 2001, the European Union has adopted a uniform set of rules and procedures for protecting the areas of any airport that are behind security checkpoints. But the methods for safeguarding of areas accessible to the general public are established at a national level and therefore vary among member states.
Vincent Gilles, president of SLFP Police, the largest police union in Belgium, with 22,000 members, said in a telephone interview that he was disturbed after hearing colleagues say that some baggage handlers had applauded the attacks in Paris that killed 130 people.
