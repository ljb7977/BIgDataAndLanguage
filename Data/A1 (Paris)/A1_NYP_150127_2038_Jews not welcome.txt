Jews not welcome
That didn’t take long. 
In the aftermath of the Charlie Hebdo massacre, Paris’ Socialist Mayor Anne Hidalgo expressed indignation over news reports suggesting some neighborhoods around the French capital were deemed no-go zones for non-Muslims. 
True, some of these stories exaggerated. But we said that before we accepted Mayor Hildalgo’s assurances that this was the insult to French honor she claimed it was, we had a little test: 
We’ll join her in her outrage at the “insult” to Parisian “honor” when an Orthodox Jew in sidelocks, beard and kippah can walk through one of these troubled suburbs at night without any fear. 
Turns out the challenge was accepted. Not in Paris, but in another European city that also has a reputation for the growing dangers to its Jewish population: Malmo, Sweden. 
Swedish reporter Petter Ljunggren donned a kippah, or head-covering, and Star of David and visited the city of Malmo. 
The results aired in a documentary on Swedish television this past weekend. In one scene, as Ljunggren reads a newspaper at a cafe, a hidden camera catches passersby hurling anti-Semitic insults; one warns him to “get out.” 
In a Muslim neighborhood, Ljunggren is surrounded by a large group of men who pepper him with insults, while eggs are tossed down from apartments above. The reporter flees the neighborhood.
It’s not Paris, but what this reporter illustrated sure sounds like a “no-go zone” — at least if you’re a European Jew. 
So how about it, Madame Mayor: Are you willing to put Paris to the same test?
