The best counterattack against terrorism
Part of the response to the terror in Paris has been as gratifying as the killings were horrifying. There have been spontaneous physical and social media expressions of solidarity with the Muslim community. These actions aren’t just morally correct; they are strategic.
We already know that the general goal of terrorists is to provoke a response as harmful as the original attacks. In Paris and other European cities, as professor Juan Cole pointed out in a recent blog post, the strategy of terrorists is even more specific: radicalize current politically and religiously apathetic Muslims. Cole cites polling in which only about a third of the 5 million people of Muslim heritage in France describe themselves as even being interested in religion. So the gunmen in Paris and other terrorists hope, with some justification, that their attacks will provoke an outbreak of hatred and violence against Muslims that will feed the paranoid narrative of the West-vs.-Islam and gradually draw Muslims to their cause.
In other words, the strategy of these terrorists is to provoke Islamophobia. The counter-strategy should be the reverse: to not only refuse to be deceived, but also to actively speak out against this perversion of reality. Put it another way: If you fear or hate Muslims more today, you have done the terrorists’ bidding. If you speak with tolerance, compassion and understanding, however, you have fought back in the most strategic way.
