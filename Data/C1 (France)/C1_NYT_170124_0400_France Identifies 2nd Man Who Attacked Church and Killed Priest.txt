France Identifies 2nd Man Who Attacked Church and Killed Priest
PARIS — The French authorities on Thursday identified a second man who stormed a church in Normandy and killed an 85-year-old priest as he celebrated Mass.
The Paris prosecutor’s office identified the man as Abdel-Malik Nabil Petitjean, 19. It was not clear how he knew the other killer, Adel Kermiche, also 19, who lived near the church, the Église St.-Étienne, in St.-Étienne-du-Rouvray, a working-class suburb of Rouen.
Both were of Algerian ancestry. They were shot dead by the police after the assault on the church on Tuesday, which also left an 86-year-old parishioner severely wounded; he is in stable condition.
The Islamic State released videos on Wednesday in which the two young men pledged allegiance to the terrorist group before the assault, which killed the Rev. Jacques Hamel.
Mr. Petitjean was born in St.-Dié-des-Vosges, in Lorraine in northeastern France, but grew up in Aix-les-Bains, in the southeast. He attended a high school there, the Lycée Marlioz, and his father lives in Montluçon, a town in central France, north of Clermont-Ferrand.
