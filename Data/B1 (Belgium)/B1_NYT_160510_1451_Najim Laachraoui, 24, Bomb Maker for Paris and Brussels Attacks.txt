Najim Laachraoui, 24, Bomb Maker for Paris and Brussels Attacks
One of the bombers who blew himself up in Brussels this week was also the bomb maker who assembled the suicide vests for two of the terrorists who carried out the Paris attacks.
Belgian officials on Friday identified Najim Laachraoui, 24, as one of two suicide bombers who attacked Brussels Airport on Tuesday.
They also said he had been involved with making at least two of the bombs used in November to attack the Bataclan concert hall in Paris and the Stade de France in St.-Denis, north of Paris.
Here is what we know about Mr. Laachraoui from public records, official statements and an interview with one of his siblings.
