French police arrest 8 people suspected of involvement in network to send fighters to Syria
France's interior minister says authorities have arrested eight people suspected of involvement in a network to send fighters to join Islamic extremists in Syria.
France is on alert after 20 people were killed in the deadliest terrorist attacks in decades.
Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve says the eight were arrested Tuesday in the Paris and Lyon areas. He said there is no suspected link to the Jan. 7-9 attacks.
Police are trying to thwart new violence and find possible accomplices to three radical Islamic gunmen who attacked a kosher grocery and newspaper Charlie Hebdo. The men claimed allegiance to extremists in the Mideast.
France has seen hundreds of homegrown radicals join Islamic State fighters in Syria and Iraq.
The men arrested Tuesday are being questioned by terrorism investigators.
