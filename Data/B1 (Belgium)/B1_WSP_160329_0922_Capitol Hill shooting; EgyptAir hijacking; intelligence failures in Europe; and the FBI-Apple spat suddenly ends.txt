Capitol Hill shooting; EgyptAir hijacking; intelligence failures in Europe; and the FBI-Apple spat suddenly ends
CAPITOL HILL SHOOTING A man with a face familiar to Capitol officials is being charged with assault after allegedly wielding a gun as he tried to enter the Capitol Visitor Center on Monday. Police on the scene shot Larry Russell Dawson, a minister from Tennessee who was previously arrested for disrupting Congress with shouts that he was a “prophet of God.” No one died, but the chaos ensued as tourists — some of whom heard shots — were caught in a lockdown, and officials corralled the type of crowds one might expect to be milling around the Capitol on a spring day during one of the peak periods of tourist season in Washington, D.C.

A female bystander was lightly injured during the incident, possibly by a bullet fragment, while everyone else — save for the shooter — seems to have come through the experience without incident. But the event is a reminder of several past incidents of shootings on the Capitol grounds.
EGYPTAIR HIJACKING While you were sleeping, a man claiming to be wearing a belt of explosives hijacked a domestic EgyptAir flight going from Alexandria to Cairo, diverting it to Cyprus; raised fears that this might be an act of international terrorism by releasing the Egyptian passengers but keeping the foreigners and crew onboard; asked to see his ex-wife, who lives in Cyprus; and after almost six hours, was eventually arrested, with no reports of deaths or injuries.

But even a relief-filled ending doesn’t mean no harm was done. Questions remain about how this man got through security with a suicide belt, or even something just resembling one — was security that lax? Or did he have help from the inside? Either way, the apparent glitch in the system isn’t going to inspire confidence among the world’s travelers — and that’s going to be bad for Egypt’s bottom line. Militant attacks, plane hijackings and last year’s bombing of a Russian passenger plane over the Sinai have all been signs to tourists and investors not to come to Egypt — Russia hasn’t even reinstated flights yet, after that attack. For a country that has historically depended so much on tourism, these incidents pose a major financial problem, even when they end short of disaster.
INTELLIGENCE FAILURES IN EUROPE In the Brussels attacks, the holes in Belgium’s security apparatus were put on display to the rest of the world. But what about the rest of Europe? And how do you get a 28-member European Union bloc whose members don’t always trust each other to uniformly take steps toward improving security and intelligence-gathering across an area where economic interconnectedness and free-travel rules arguably make one country’s terror cell every other country’s problem? And with the threat now present and clear, how do you do it fast?
  [ 
These are all questions of the highest priority as European countries try to crack down on facing a terror threat that has already claimed scores of lives in Paris and Brussels, without the benefit of a single security or intelligence agency to coordinate such actions at a pan-European level. Europe already has a central database for security officials to share information — but the problem is that there are no rules about what countries might put in, and some intelligence agencies aren’t too keen on giving away trade secrets.
MUCH ADO ABOUT HACKING It was shaping up to be the big government-vs.-privacy fight of the year, as the FBI took Apple to court, demanding the tech giant design software to unlock the San Bernardino shooter’s iPhone. But just like that, the bubbling drama is over, as it appears the FBI managed to access the data in the phone without Apple’s help. We don’t know the details of how it happened — although the FBI had hinted last week that it might have found another option. And if it worked, it’s not clear they’re going to be telling Apple about the workaround for a vulnerability in its system.
