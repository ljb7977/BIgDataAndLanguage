A Blurry Photo Hints at ISIS Tradecraft
The grainy image captured on a surveillance camera at Brussels Airport shows three men pushing luggage carts into the check-in terminal. Their expressions seem casual, even relaxed.
We have come to expect this demeanor from the Islamic State fighters dispatched from Syria to carry out mass murder in Europe. “Calm” and “determined” were among the most frequently used descriptions by witnesses who saw the attackers during the November attacks in Paris. “Ready to die,” was another.
Belgian officials have identified the three men in the photo as central suspects in the bombings at the airport: Two of them, in black and wearing single black gloves on their left hands, were thought to have been killed.
The third, wearing white, is still being sought in the attack, which along with another bombing at a train station was quickly claimed by the Islamic State militant group.
On Wednesday, the authorities identified two brothers as bombers in the attacks — Khalid el-Bakraoui, 27, and Ibrahim el-Bakraoui, 29; they said Ibrahim was responsible for one of the airport bombs, but Khalid’s role remained unclear.
