Shares Decline After Terror Attacks in Belgium
United States stock indexes closed mostly lower on Tuesday as shares of airlines, cruise companies and travel booking sites fell after the deadly bombings in Belgium.
News of the attacks, which killed more than 30 people, pulled the broader market lower for much of the morning. An early afternoon rally erased some of the losses, but the rebound didn’t hold.
Oil drilling companies also slumped after a downbeat forecast on drilling. Health care and technology stocks gained ground.
The slide ended a four-day market winning streak. Trading was relatively light, reflecting the approaching Easter holiday weekend. It also signaled that traders were not rattled by the potential market implications of the attack.
“What happens is investors and traders go in and start to bottom-fish on sectors that have sold off,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. “It flies in the face of the headlines and the human cost of these terrorist attacks, but the stock markets tend to turn around.”
