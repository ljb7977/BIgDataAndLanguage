Belgian Police Release New Video of Brussels Airport Suspect
PARIS — The Belgian authorities released video footage on Thursday that retraced the steps of a man suspected of taking part in the March 22 bombing of the Brussels Airport and renewed their appeal to the public for help in identifying him.
The video, presented at a news conference at the federal prosecutor’s office in Brussels, shows surveillance-camera footage of the suspect in the nearly two hours after the attacks at the airport, where two suicide bombers detonated explosives contained in large black luggage.
A third suicide bomber detonated explosives at the Maelbeek subway station in central Brussels a little over an hour later. Thirty-two people were killed and over 340 wounded in the series of  attacks, which were claimed by the Islamic State. On Thursday, the Belgian health minister, Maggie De Block, said that 57 people were still hospitalized, 28 of them in intensive care.
The Belgian authorities had already issued a wanted notice for the suspect, known as the “man in the hat” because of his appearance in a photograph that was released soon after the attacks.
Belgian investigators are still working to identify the people who organized and carried out the attacks.
