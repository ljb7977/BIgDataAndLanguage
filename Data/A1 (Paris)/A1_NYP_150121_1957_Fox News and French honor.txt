Fox News and French honor
Let’s see if we’ve got this straight. 
Seventeen French citizens are murdered in Paris in cold blood by homegrown terrorists — and the city’s mayor expresses her outrage for . . . Fox News?
Socialist Mayor Anne Hildalgo says she plans to sue the news channel for recent on-air comments that her city has zones where police and non-Muslims do not go. (Fox also had a guest, Steve Emerson, who incorrectly called Birmingham, England, a “totally Muslim” city.) In any case, Fox News has apologized for both, conceding there are no formal no-go zones in Paris.
But hang on a minute. 
It’s no secret Paris’ desperate banlieues, or suburbs, include considerable North African and sub-Saharan Muslim populations who’ve largely failed to integrate into French society. We also know these places have been home to violence and riots. And we remember how in 2006 a French Jew was kidnapped by a banlieue gang and tortured to death over three weeks. Despite his screams, no one called the cops. 
So while we’re on the subject of apologies, maybe French President François Hollande should offer one for his claim that the gunmen who murdered to avenge the Prophet Mohammed had “nothing to do” with Islam. Really? Nothing to do with Islam? Or how about a larger apology to France’s Jewish citizens, whom the government appears incapable of protecting?
Here’s a test for Mayor Hildalgo. 
We’ll join her in her outrage at the “insult” to Parisian “honor” when an Orthodox Jew in sidelocks, beard and kippah can walk through one of these troubled suburbs at night without any fear.
