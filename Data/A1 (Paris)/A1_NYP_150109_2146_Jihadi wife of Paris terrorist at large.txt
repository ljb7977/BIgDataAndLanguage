French police are on the hunt for the 26-year-old burqa-wearing, crossbow-shooting wife of kosher-grocery-store shooter and cop killer Amedy Coulibaly.
Hayat Boumeddiene, who police say is “armed and dangerous,” trained alongside her beau at a jihadist camp in the French countryside and is a suspect in the murder of a female cop on Thursday.
In 2009, the blood-thirsty brunette traded in her low-paying job as a cashier for the terrorist life, according to French newspaper Le Monde.

Photographs obtained by the Daily Mail show a burka-clad Boumeddiene down on both knees, aiming a crossbow. She points the weapon directly at the camera in one shot.
Another picture shows the young woman in a skimpy bikini alongside a man believed to be Coulibaly.
The two have been together since 2010 and Boumeddiene lived in Coulibaly’s apartment while he was in prison for his part in a plot to spring Paris metro bomber Smain Ait Ali Belkacem from jail, according to the Independent.
Boumeddiene also trained at the jihadist camp with convicted terrorist Djamel Beghal, who plotted to bomb the US Embassy in Paris.
She was previously interviewed by French anti-terror police in 2010, but it is unclear whether any action was taken against her.
Boumeddiene escaped from the grocery store during the confusion as the freed hostages ran away following the siege that left Coulibaly dead.
