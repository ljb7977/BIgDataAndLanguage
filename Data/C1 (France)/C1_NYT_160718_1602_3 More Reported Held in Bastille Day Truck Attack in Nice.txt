3 More Reported Held in Bastille Day Truck Attack in Nice
PARIS — France, still reeling from the attack on Thursday in the southern coastal city of Nice that killed 84 people, observed its second of three days of national mourning on Sunday, as the French police held three more people in connection with the assault, according to news reports.
The nation has been left wondering whether the attack, in which a Tunisian man plowed a 19-ton refrigerated truck through crowds gathered for fireworks on Bastille Day, could have been avoided — or whether it must adjust to a harsh new reality.
On Saturday, the Islamic State claimed responsibility for the assault, calling the driver, Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel, its “soldier.”
But no evidence has emerged so far that Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel, 31, a delivery truck driver living in Nice, was in contact with the Islamic State, or that he was exposed to its propaganda.
A man and a woman were arrested Sunday morning, French news media reported, and another man was detained later on Sunday, according to Agence France-Presse.
None were identified, although some reports said that the man and woman were an Albanian couple, and that the man was suspected of providing Mr. Lahouaiej Bouhlel with the automatic pistol he used on the night of the attack.
