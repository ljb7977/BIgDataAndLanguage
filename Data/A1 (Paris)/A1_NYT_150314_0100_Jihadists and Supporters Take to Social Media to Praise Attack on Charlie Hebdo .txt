Jihadists and Supporters Take to Social Media to Praise Attack on Charlie Hebdo 

BEIRUT, Lebanon —  Within hours of the deadly attack on the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, Islamic extremists and their supporters were praising the killings and lauding the attackers on social media under hashtags like #we_avenged_the_prophet and #lone_wolves.
The attack on Wednesday and the subsequent manhunt shook France and unleashed an international outpouring of sympathy for the victims.
But for jihadists from North Africa to Pakistan, the attack was a justified blow against a state perceived as an enemy of Islam.
“Two lions terrified all of Paris and made #paris_burn,” boasted a post on one jihadi Twitter feed, above a photo of the two gunmen close to the time of the attack.
Elsewhere on social media, jihadists and their supporters remixed attack videos, adding sound effects and jihadist anthems, and spread photos of the attackers, calling them martyrs and heroes. One account even posted a jihadist poem, in French.
