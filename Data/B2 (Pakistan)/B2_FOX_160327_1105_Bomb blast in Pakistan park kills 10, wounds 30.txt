Bomb blast in Pakistan park kills 10, wounds 30
Pakistani police say at least 10 people have been killed and 30 wounded in a blast in a park in the eastern city of Lahore.
Senior police officer Haider Ashraf says the explosion took place Sunday in the parking area of Gulshan-e-Iqbal park. He says the explosion appeared to have been a suicide bombing, but investigations were ongoing.
He says the area was crowded because Christians are celebrating the Easter holiday and many families were leaving the park when the blast occurred. He says the death toll could still rise as many of the wounded were in a critical condition.
