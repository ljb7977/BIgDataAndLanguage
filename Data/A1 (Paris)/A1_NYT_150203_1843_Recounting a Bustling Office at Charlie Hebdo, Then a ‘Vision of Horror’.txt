Recounting a Bustling Office at Charlie Hebdo, Then a ‘Vision of Horror’

PARIS — Stéphane Charbonnier was perched, as was his habit every Wednesday morning, at a U-shaped wooden table on the second floor of the light-filled Parisian offices of Charlie Hebdo, the French satirical newspaper he headed. An array of papers was spread before him.
It was about 11:30, and a dozen or so journalists, including the paper’s top cartoonists, had joined him for their regular weekly meeting to pore over the articles that would appear in the next issue. Their day had already been productive: Less than two hours earlier, the editors published their latest provocative cartoon on Twitter, a sketch of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State terrorist group, wishing his audience a happy new year, and “above all, good health!”
They did not know that a scene of terror was unfolding at their doorstep, one that would grip the world’s attention and raise new fears across Europe about a clash of civilizations, between radical Islam and the West.
Corinne Rey, a cartoonist who goes by the pen name Coco, was tapping in a security code to enter the building when two men in black commando garb, armed with AK-47 assault rifles, grabbed her and forced her to open the door. “They wanted to get in and go up,” she later told the French newspaper L’Humanité.
Pushed inside, Ms. Rey took refuge as the gunmen crossed the lobby to the reception desk, where Frédéric Boisseau, a security guard at the building for 15 years, was sitting. According to a witness quoted in the French news media, the attackers opened fire, killing Mr. Boisseau and spraying the area with so much gunfire that some people thought a scaffold was falling.
