Garbage ‘shrine’ built where Bastille Day attacker was killed
A makeshift shrine has taken root at the spot where the Bastille Day terrorist was shot dead — with garbage, stones and messages of hate piling up.
Passers-by sickened and enraged by Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel’s truck rampage in Nice, which left 84 people dead and scores injured last Thursday, have been dumping trash and spitting on the mound.
Someone scrawled “Coward!” at the spot near where Bouhlel’s truck ended its deadly run amid a hail of police bullets, The Local reported.
Among the messages left at the site were the words “F— Daesh,” another name for ISIS, along with an image of a middle finger.
Meanwhile, a loving memorial lies nearby for the victims, including 10 children, on the Promenade des Anglais. Among the items left were a sea of flowers, candles and teddy bears.
