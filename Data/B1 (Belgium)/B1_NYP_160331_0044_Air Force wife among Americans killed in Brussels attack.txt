Air Force wife among Americans killed in Brussels attack
Gail Minglana Martinez, a Texas native and wife of an Air Force lieutenant colonel, was one of the people killed in the Brussels attacks, a US congressman said Wednesday.
Martinez, 41, was identified as a victim by the office of Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Texas), who said in a statement that he’d spoken to her brother.
Martinez was married to Lt. Col. Kato Martinez, who Farenthold said is still hospitalized due to the blast, as are the couple’s four children.
Martinez grew up in Corpus Christi, Texas. She graduated from a local high school in 1992.
Her husband serves as a military assistant to the commander at NATO’s Joint Force Command in the Netherlands. It’s not yet known where in Brussels the family was when they were injured.
