Brussels Survivors Say Blasts Instantly Evoked Paris Attacks
BRUSSELS — Simon O’Connor, a European Commission official, had parked his car and was about to walk toward the departure terminal, en route to Rome for work. Salomé Corbo, an actress from Montreal, was at the Air Canada counter, about to check her luggage. Elouan Preaud and his wife, Angelina Centeno, were having breakfast, waiting to board an American Airlines flight to her native Colombia.
Then came the blasts.
The first one tore through the check-in area at Brussels Airport just before 8 a.m. on Tuesday. Another followed, seconds later, near a Starbucks.
Mr. Preaud and his wife, who is pregnant, hit the ground as people screamed, “Get down, get down!” After the second explosion, he looked up to see a giant fan — part of an air-conditioning unit — that had landed near them. They had been eating at a Délifrance, talking about Salah Abdeslam, the terrorism suspect who was arrested in Brussels on Friday after a four-month global manhunt.
“In 10 seconds, everything changed,” Mr. Preaud said. “It was an apocalypse. There was blood everywhere.”
Ms. Corbo, like other witnesses, said the second blast was stronger than the first.
“I felt myself pushed forward as if by a force of air,” she said in a phone interview. “People dove to the ground. Parts of the ceiling fell in. There were some injured people lying on the ground. I saw a foot that had been blown off.”
Mr. O’Connor, the European Commission official, described hearing “two deeply rumbling crashes” as he approached the terminal from the parking lot.
