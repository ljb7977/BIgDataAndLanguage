Dozens Killed in Suicide Attack on Shiite Shrine North of Baghdad

BAGHDAD — Militants fired mortars on a Shiite shrine north of Baghdad late on Thursday, and in the confusion that followed, three suicide bombers in military uniforms infiltrated the compound and blew themselves up, the Iraqi authorities said.
At least 36 people were killed and more than 40 were wounded.
The attack occurred just days after a minivan packed with explosives detonated in central Baghdad, killing at least 250 people and wounding nearly 200.
Thursday’s attack occurred in Balad, about 55 miles from Baghdad, at the mausoleum of Sayyid Muhammad bin Ali al-Hadi, a son of the 10th imam, who is revered among Shiites. Crowds of pilgrims had gathered there to celebrate Eid al-Fitr, which ends the holy month of Ramadan.
Two of the bombers detonated their explosives near the gate of the mausoleum, and a third rushed deeper into the shrine and threw hand grenades at pilgrims, the authorities said.
At least 20 militants then overwhelmed the police and militia guards and seized control of the compound for about a half-hour before reinforcements arrived from the federal and local police and members of the Popular Mobilization Forces, an irregular unit. Those forces then clashed with the militants outside the shrine, killing at least seven.
