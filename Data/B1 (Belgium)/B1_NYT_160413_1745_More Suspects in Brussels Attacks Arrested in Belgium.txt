More Suspects in Brussels Attacks Arrested in Belgium
PARIS — The Belgian authorities said Friday evening that one of the five people arrested earlier in the day in connection with the March 22 attacks in Brussels was a fugitive who is suspected of playing a significant role in the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris.
That suspect, Mohamed Abrini, 31, was arrested on Place Albert in the Anderlecht section of Brussels after a nearly five-month international manhunt, Eric Van der Sijpt, a spokesman for the Belgian prosecutor’s office, said at a news conference in Brussels, the Belgian capital. Two people were arrested with Mr. Abrini; their names were not made public.
What role Mr. Abrini may have played in the Paris attacks is still unclear, but he is suspected of providing logistical help to the assailants who killed 130 people in and around Paris in November, and an arrest warrant was issued for him.
After the arrest on March 18 of Salah Abdeslam, who is thought to be the sole survivor who directly participated in the shootings and bombings in Paris, Mr. Abrini became the most wanted man in connection with them.
The latest arrests again raised the question of how a suspect whose identity and appearance were known and circulated widely could manage to evade the Belgian authorities for months.
Mr. Abrini, whose description was released by the Belgian authorities 10 days after the Paris attacks, appears to have spent at least a part of that time less than three miles from his home in the Molenbeek district of Brussels, like Mr. Abdeslam, who was arrested after four months on the run.
