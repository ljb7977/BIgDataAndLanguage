Leaders vow to protect freedom of press following Paris massacre
Outrage over the French newspaper bloodbath Wednesday stretched from one corner of the globe to another, with world leader after world leader condemning the deadly terrorist shooting.
Presidents and prime ministers took turns denouncing the massacre, and vowed to protect freedom of the press.
“I strongly condemn the horrific shooting at the offices of Charlie Hebdo magazine in Paris,” President Obama said.
“France, and the great city of Paris where this outrageous attack took place, offer the world a timeless example that will endure well beyond the hateful vision of these killers. We are in touch with French officials and I have directed my administration to provide any assistance needed to help bring these terrorists to justice.”
French President Francois Hollande lashed out at the killers, and said the country stood united against terrorists.
“No barbaric act will ever extinguish the freedom of the press,” Hollande said. “We are a united country that will react as one.”
“The murders in Paris are sickening,” said British Prime Minister David Cameron. “We stand with the French people in the fight against terror and defending the freedom of the press.”
