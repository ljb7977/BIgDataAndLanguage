The Day Horror Invaded the Park

Lahore, Pakistan — A POLICE officer standing guard in front of Gulshan-e-Iqbal Park on Tuesday morning glared when I asked him to recount Sunday’s events. Ushering me into the park, he said to see for myself.
On Sunday, hundreds of people — mostly families with children — had gathered at Gulshan-e-Iqbal, one of the city’s largest parks, to enjoy the Easter day and the temperate weather. Griffin Iqbal, his wife, Samia, and their sons, 6-year-old Max and 4-year-old Adan, headed over after their church service. The boys spent their pocket money on popcorn and ice cream from a stall near the blue fountain and a ride called Hilly Gilly.
Around 6:15 p.m., Mr. Iqbal told the children it was time to leave. Adan dropped to the ground and kicked his legs in protest. His father scooped him up, took Max’s hand and walked to the gate. They had barely stepped out of the park when their ears rang with a deafening explosion and the ground shook.
Fearing a stampede, Mr. Iqbal told people running toward the park that the machinery of one of the rides must have malfunctioned. “But my words were drowned by screams that issued from the park,” he said.
A splinter group of the Pakistani Taliban called Jamaat-e-Ahrar claimed responsibility for the attack, which killed at least 72 people, including dozens of children, and injured hundreds. The group said the target of its suicide bomber was the Christian minority, celebrating Easter. But when the city’s hospitals counted the dead, they found that more Muslims than Christians had been killed.
