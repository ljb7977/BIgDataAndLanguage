In Belgium, a Country of Divisions, Patriotism Remains Subdued
BRUSSELS — In the United States, the Sept. 11 attacks unleashed an outpouring of patriotism. After the attacks in and around Paris on Nov. 13, the tricolor of the French flag was ubiquitous as the country channeled its grief.
Not so in Belgium. In this wounded nation, politically fragmented and divided between Dutch-speaking Flanders in the north and French-speaking Wallonia in the south, displays of the black, yellow and red of the Belgian flag have been relatively restrained, even as the Eiffel Tower lit up in its colors.
“We Belgians do not wrap ourselves in the flag — it is not our way,” said Nicolas Gallet, 19, who was among thousands on Thursday who thronged Place de La Bourse, a square in central Brussels filled with flowers and candles, and memorial messages chalked on asphalt. Instead, in a decidedly Belgian gesture, an image of the beloved cartoon character Tintin and his dog Snowy crying was widely shared on social media by Belgians and foreigners alike.
Like their counterparts around the world, Belgians reacted to the terror attacks that killed 31 people at an airport and subway station Tuesday morning with the all-too-familiar rituals of public mourning and with grief, anger, shock and defiance. But perhaps befitting a country with three Parliaments, which once went without a government for 541 days, the understated displays of solidarity were tinged with simmering frustration as a blame game began.
Some Belgians lashed out at a flailing security apparatus and chronically dysfunctional government for abetting the tragedy.
