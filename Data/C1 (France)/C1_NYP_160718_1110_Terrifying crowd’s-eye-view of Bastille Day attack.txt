Terrifying crowd’s-eye-view of Bastille Day attack
The blood-curdling screams of unsuspecting terror attack victims can be heard just seconds before their deaths in a new video that has emerged of the Bastille Day tragedy.
Footage shot by a bystander caught up in the chaos shows the head-on view of innocent revelers as a crazed killer drove his truck through the crowds.
Driver Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel killed 84 people and injured 202 on Thursday.
The video shows crowds, including families pushing strollers, happily enjoying live music on the Promenade des Anglais, with hundreds of people walking through the streets.
But the calm scene is interrupted by the white truck speeding through the streets and hitting anyone in its path.
People can be seen trying to jump out of the path of the truck.
The heart-breaking cries of a desperate woman can then be heard, with the mother crying “my daughter, my daughter” several times.
The fate of the mother and daughter is not known.
