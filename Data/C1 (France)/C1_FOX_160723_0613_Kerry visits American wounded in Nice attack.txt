Kerry visits American wounded in Nice attack
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is on a private visit to Nice, France where he visited an American citizen recovering from injuries sustained in the July 14 truck attack in the Mediterranean city.
The State Department said Kerry met with the unidentified victim of the attack in a local hospital on Saturday. It gave no further details.
Kerry is in France on the second leg of a round-the-world diplomatic trip that began on Friday in Vienna, Austria. He was to have met in Paris with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, but that meeting was postponed due to a death in Abbas' family. Kerry departs France on Sunday for Laos, where he will attend at Southeast Asian regional security conference and then make a stop in the Philippines' capital of Manila.
